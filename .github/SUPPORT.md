## Common Issues
- **AI fails to populate components**: Ensure your API key is active and valid.
- **Component not rendering**: Check for missing references in the component file. The code generation used is isolated so it may expect certain imports or variables to be set. Ensure the hooks are set properly.
- **Command not found**: Make sure you've installed globally
- **Version conflicts**: Check Node.js version requirements
